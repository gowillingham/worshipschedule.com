		We're sorry that you are experiencing problems logging into Worshipschedule. Some 
		reasons for this are:</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Logging in with the wrong password. </strong>If you think that you've might have forgotten your password, you can recover it by clicking on the 'Forgot Password'
		link on the login page. When you select this link, you'll need to provide your user
		name. Then Worshipschedule will send you your current password via the email address
		registered in your account.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Logging in with the wrong user name. </strong> If you have forgotten your
		user name, you may be able to recover it from the welcome email you should have received from Worshipschedule when your
		account was created (although you may have
		changed your user name since then).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have changed your user name and subsequently forgotten it, you'll need to
		contact the Worshipschedule account administrator for your church (the person from
		your church who manages your Worshipschedule account) and have them send you your
		account credentials.</p>
